# My first blog post

Posted on: 2022-07-01

Welcome to my _new blog_ about learning Astro! Here, I'm going to share my learning journey as I build a new website.

## What I've accomplished

1. **Installing Astro**: First, I've created a new Astro project and set up my online accounts.

2. **Creating Pages**: I then learned how to make pages by creating new `.astro` files and placing them in the `src/pages/` folder.

3. **Creating Posts**: This is my first post! I now have Astro pages and Markdown posts!

## Next Steps

I'll finish the Astro tutorial, and then continue adding more posts. Watch this space for more to come.
